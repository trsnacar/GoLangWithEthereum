# GoLangWithEthereum
Calling an Ethereum contract with go lang with API
What I've built here is an Ethereum application written in Go. This app connects to the Ethereum network as an HTTP server and receives HTTP requests to perform Ethereum transactions. The application connects to the Ethereum network at "https://mainnet.infura.io" and creates an instance of an Ethereum smart contract located at "0x12345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890".
